I plan on using the Home Assistant wled library: `wled` located here: https://pypi.org/project/wled/

## Prometheus

For prometheus I have some options:

* https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator
* https://github.com/prometheus/client_python
* https://prometheus.github.io/client_python/exporting/http/fastapi-gunicorn/
